## Design
Same design as iPhone X, but bigger
A touch shorter and narrow than the iPhone 8 Plus, with a bigger screen
The iPhone XS Max design is deceptive. Pick it up, and the rounded sides of the handset make it feel noticeably thick.

The result is a phone that doesn't sit as comfortably in the hand as it could, and considering the size and cost of the XS Max it's a phone you want to be able to securely hold. This is only half the story though.

There's no headphone jack on the iPhone XS Max. The port is now totally dead after Apple killed off the iPhone 6S and iPhone SE post-iPhone XS launch (the last two handsets with the 3.5mm jack that were available from the firm's site), which means you get a centralized Lightning port alongside speaker and microphone holes on the base of the iPhone XS Max.

# Performance
The A12 Bionic processor is the first 7-nanometer chip in a phone, but what's more important is what that enables. Apple claims that the two high-performance cores in this 6-core processor are up to 15 percent faster, and that the 4-core GPU is up to 50 percent faster.
