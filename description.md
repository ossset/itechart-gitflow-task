# Description

iPhone Xs Max, here everything is clear: this is the perfect smartphone for those who spend most of their lives in front of the gadget screen. It is inconvenient to use the device with one hand, but if you buy a device with such a diagonal, you donâ€™t really think about comfort - the most important thing is how the content looks. And there are no problems with this: that the video, the games, the tapes of social networks or news media are all just perfect. Except for the price. But the flagship for a thousand-odd dollars is a new reality. Cheaper they will not be.

## Design
Same design as iPhone X, but bigger
A touch shorter and narrow than the iPhone 8 Plus, with a bigger screen
The iPhone XS Max design is deceptive. Pick it up, and the rounded sides of the handset make it feel noticeably thick.

The result is a phone that doesn't sit as comfortably in the hand as it could, and considering the size and cost of the XS Max it's a phone you want to be able to securely hold. This is only half the story though.

There's no headphone jack on the iPhone XS Max. The port is now totally dead after Apple killed off the iPhone 6S and iPhone SE post-iPhone XS launch (the last two handsets with the 3.5mm jack that were available from the firm's site), which means you get a centralized Lightning port alongside speaker and microphone holes on the base of the iPhone XS Max.

# Performance
The A12 Bionic processor is the first 7-nanometer chip in a phone, but what's more important is what that enables. Apple claims that the two high-performance cores in this 6-core processor are up to 15 percent faster, and that the 4-core GPU is up to 50 percent faster.
