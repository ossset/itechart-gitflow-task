Since the last 10 best list, Samsung released the newest variation of the Galaxy S10 as the Galaxy S10 5G. While 5G is still in its infancy and just started to roll out in select cities in the US, the S10 5G still offers a couple of improvements over the S10 Plus that makes it arguably the best smartphone available today.

While the Galaxy Note 9 is a stunning device, Samsung pulled out all the stops on the S10 Plus with a newer processor, more RAM, larger capacity battery, and two extra cameras when compared to the Galaxy Note 9. Samsung's current mass market flagship is a winner in almost every respect.

OnePlus launched the new OnePlus 7 Pro just a couple of weeks ago and it is already being universally lauded for its lovely design, fast performance, and sheer power at a price comparable to the lowest level Apple and Samsung flagship phones. OnePlus continues to challenge flagship phones with high end internal specs at prices hundreds less than competing premium phones.
